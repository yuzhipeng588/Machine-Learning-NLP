	Built a patent evaluating system to automatically give advices of amendment for applicants before starting their application process in order to increase the possibility of first allowance.

	Paired failed claims and granted claims from two separate dataset provided by USPTO (US Patent and Trademark Office) using Hadoop/Mapreduce framework.

	Implemented a Seq2seq model with WordEmbedding technique using TensorFlow and Keras.

 Trained the model by paired claim txt data which were published in 2012.

There are several early models for testing that have been already set up.
