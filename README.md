Abstract
This project aims at providing a patent claim scoring system for patent applicants and patent lawyers. This patent claim scoring system can predict whether a given patent claim can be approved without any changes. It also gives a score that indicates the probability for the claim to be approved without making any changes. Moreover, this system can identify the top 10 most similar previously approved claims, and highlight the words used in the input claim that may have a positive or a negative impact on the application. Using our system would allow patent applicants and lawyers to save time during the examination process. Indeed, if the application is rejected by the patent office, restarting an application usually takes about six months. It also costs added application fee. In this project, we tackle this problem by using a machine learning model. Because of the limit of computing resource, we are only interested in the newest data. Therefore the model is trained on 90,000 claims initially published in 2012 and it is then tested on 9,000 claims that were initially published in 2013. Model gets 65.34% accuracy on test set.

There are several early models for testing that have been already set up.

new model folder inlcludes all the current models.
