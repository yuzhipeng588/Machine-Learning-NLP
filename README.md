 Built a patent claim scoring system to predict the changes between failed and granted claims before starting application process and indicated the most positively and negatively affecting words.

 Implemented a RNN model with processing techniques such as bag of words, ti-idf and WordEmbedding.

 Paired failed claims and granted claims from two csv files provided by USPTO (US Patent and Trademark
Office).

 Trained the model by paired claim txt data which were published in 2014.

There are 4 models that have been set up.
